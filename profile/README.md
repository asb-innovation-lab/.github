# Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund Innovation Lab

This is the **official** Innovation Lab of the Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund, Ortsverband Hamburg-Nordost e.V. 

## Project description

The ASB Innovation Lab is a team of mostly young people who take care of the digitalization and media presence of the local association. 

Among other things, one of our teams, ErsteHilfe2Go, is currently working on an app and website to make first aid digital for all people. 
The app is currently the main project of the Innovation Lab. 
Other projects will follow soon. 
We are helped by volunteer doctors, paramedics, trainers, lawyers, programmers and others. 
These make up a large part of our project.
